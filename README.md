  <summary><b>🔬 Bio</b></summary>
  I'm a javascript developer and UX enthusiast passionate about design systems and web accessibility.  React is my frontend library of choice–if I'm not keeping it vanilla, and Neovim my editor of choice. 
  When I'm not coding, I thoroughly enjoy making and eating (hawaiian) pizza, playing on my nintendo switch, and reading or learning about philosophy. I've interned as a software engineer at both Intel
  and Workiva, where I wrote tests, technical documentation, and web code amongst many other things.

I currently work at [Searchspring](https://searchspring.com/) as an Implementations Engineer 🥳
