  <summary><b>🔬 Bio</b></summary>
  I'm a javascript developer and UX enthusiast passionate about design systems and web accessibility.  If I'm not keeping it vanilla I like React for building UI's and I use Neovim for coding it all up. 
  When I'm not coding, I thoroughly enjoy making and eating (hawaiian) pizza, playing on my PC and nintendo switch, and reading/learning about psychology and philosophy. 
  I've interned as a software engineer at both Intel and Workiva and have worked as a Frontend Engineer for Searchspring, where I wrote web code among many other things.
