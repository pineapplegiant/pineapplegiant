  <summary><b>🔬 Bio</b></summary>
  I'm a huge nerd and when I'm not coding, you'll find me making pizza, playing
  on my switch, or trying to read 3 books at once. I've interned at both Intel
  and Workiva in a software engineering role, where I wrote tests, technical
  documentation, and web code amongst other things.
